# spaceship_titanic_predictive_model_kaggle

I joined the [Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Competition] in March of 2024. This is a ongoing, neverending competition. My participation is primarily to practice and get reps building predictiive modles, primarily classification models in this case. This repo will store all my work on this data set.
